# Image Convolution Explorer

## Project Overview

Image Convolution Explorer is an interactive web application that demonstrates the power of convolution operations in digital image processing. This project allows users to upload images and apply various convolution filters in real-time, visualizing how these fundamental algorithms transform digital imagery.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Filter Application**: Apply various image filters with immediate visual feedback
- **Progressive Processing**: Watch filters apply section-by-section for educational insight
- **Multiple Filter Options**:
  - Gaussian Blur: Smooth images with configurable kernel sizes
  - Laplacian Edge Detection: Highlight edges and transitions in images
  - Sharpening Filter: Enhance image details and boundaries
  - Color Channel Isolation: View individual RGB channels separately
  - Black & White Conversion: Convert images to binary with adjustable thresholds

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js with Axios for API requests and EventSource for streaming responses
- **Backend**: Python Flask server with a RESTful API architecture
- **Image Processing**: NumPy and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for efficient matrix operations
- **Data Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for progressive image processing feedback

### Key Technical Concepts

#### Convolution Operations

At the heart of this project is the convolution operation, a fundamental mathematical technique in image processing. The application implements convolution through these steps:

1. Apply padding to the input image to handle boundary pixels
2. For each pixel position, multiply a kernel matrix with the surrounding pixel values
3. Sum these multiplied values to compute the output pixel value
4. Repeat across the entire image to generate the transformed result

#### Kernels Implemented

```
Laplacian Kernel:  Sharpening Kernel:  Gaussian Kernel:
[ 0,  1,  0]       [ 0, -1,  0]        Dynamic generation based
[ 1, -4,  1]       [-1,  9, -1]        on specified kernel size
[ 0,  1,  0]       [ 0, -1,  0]        using Gaussian function
```

#### Progressive Processing

To handle large images efficiently, the application:

1. Divides images into horizontal strips for batch processing
2. Processes each strip sequentially with a small overlap
3. Streams results to the client as they become available
4. Provides a seamless visual experience of the filter application
